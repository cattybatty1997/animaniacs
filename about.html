    <h2>About Animaniacs</h2>
    <section>
    <p>This is the page all about the Animaniacs team. We work hard so that you can be informed on all things anime and manga. In the beginning, the animaniacs team came together in a class on webdesign. This site is the result of all our efforts so that you could have a valuavble anime and manga experience. There are four people in our animaniacs team:</p>
    <dl>
    <dt>Sarah</dt>
        <dd>"The Walking Anime Dictionary" - The leader of the group with the most knowledge on anime and manga than anyone else in the group. Sarah has been labeled an "otaku" by friends and family ever since she first entered the anime community 3 years ago.</dd> 
    <dt>Maryam</dt> 
        <dd>"Anime Movie Watcher" - The animaniac most familiar with anime movies, especially those made by Studio Chibli and Hayao Miyazaki.</dd>
    <dt>Flavio</dt>
        <dd>"Simple Animaniac" - A viewer of only a few anime, Flavio has mostly experienced anime that contain harem and fanservice aspects.</dd>
    <dt> Tanishka</dt>
        <dd>"The Noob" - Only just entering the anime world on July 16, 2013, Tanishka has viewed only a few episodes in a series of anime. She is the main source of information about new anime viewers like you.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p> Our goal is to help those that are just beginning to take the very first steps into the anime world. For example we have common used words in anime, and what the best 20 anime and best 20 manga (in our opinion) are so you can continue anime and manga.</p>
